# Liver_Cancer_Spatial_Transcriptomics
We used nHDP model to learn gene expression modules (GEMs) from scRNA data, and then use the learned model to infer GEM expression level on spatial transcriptomics data. Then we tried to establish GEM-Ligand-Recptor-GEM causual relationships.

## Step 1:
Download the proejct folder to local.
## Step 2:
Download raw data from "DataAccessWeb", put the downloaded file into a folder called "raw_data". Put "raw_data" folder in the project folder.
